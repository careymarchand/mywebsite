      <h3> What is a Millennial? </h3>
      <p>Anyone born between <strong>1981 and 1996</strong> (ages 22-37 in 2018) will be considered a Millennial, and anyone born from 1997 onward is to be part of a new generation.</p>
        <b></b>
        <p>  Anyone born after 1996 is part of a new, yet-to-be named generation that is being reffered to as “post-Millennials” until a better name is established. </p> </div>
