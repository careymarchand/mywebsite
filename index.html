    <h3> What is a Millennial? </h3>
    <p>Anyone born between <strong>1981 and 1996</strong> (ages 22-37 in 2018) will be considered a Millennial, and anyone born from 1997 onward is to be part of a new generation.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>Anyone born after 1996 is part of a new, yet-to-be named generation that is being reffered to as “post Millennials” until a better name is established. </p>

  <h3> Things Millennials Remember </h3>
    <img class="left" src="images/blockbuster.jpg" alt="blockbuster"/>
      <p> BLOCKBUSTER: Remember returning movie rentals into the return slot? Or how you knew your Friday night was going to be <strong> LIT </strong> because you spent an hour choosing the perfect movie to rent for the weekend?  "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil. </p></div>

      <p> WHEN THE TEACHER BROUGHT IN THE TV: the best day ever was when the teacher rolled in the tv and you spent the day watching <i> Bill Nye the Science Guy.</i></p>

  <h3> Say What? </h3>
    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

  <h3> In Conclusion...</h3>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
