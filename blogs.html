    <section><p>I never planned on being a mother. My mom was a single mom of 3 kids by the time she was 24, and then she had 2 more boys about 10 years later. I watched her give up all of her free time and miss out on her 20’s to raise us.</p>
    <p>I always told myself that would <b>never</b> be me.</p>
    <p>In my mind I was too selfish to be a mom. I LOVE sleep, and I had grown accustom to the freedom that came with being a single person who didn’t have to answer to anyone.</p>
    <p>And yet here I am, a mama of 2 boys.</p>
    <p>The day I became a mom was one of the happiest days of my life.  That sweet little boy grew up before my eyes and was followed by a baby brother. </p>
    <p>I can’t pinpoint the exact moment my mind changed. I had been in a happy, healthy relationship with my partner for a few years at this point and it just happened. One day I could imagine having a little family of my own. </p>
    <p>I had my first son when I was 25. I decided to move home to Kamloops from Victoria to be closer to my mom when we found out. He was born on February 19, 2015 and he was 9 pounds 5 ounces. He was beautiful. We named him Alexander David. Alex is a quiet (sometimes stubborn) soul, he is happy playing with his switch and has the biggest heart.</p>
    <p>I had my second son when I was 28. He was born on August 27, 2017. He was 7 pounds. We named him Connor Jordan. Connor is a wile 3-year-old now who loves dinosaurs and Godzilla. He teaches me patience.</p>
    <p>Although I never wanted to have children, the love I feel for these two little humans is unlike anything I have ever experienced.</p>
    <p>Watching them grow into rambunctious little boys has been amazing. I believe I was meant to have little boys. They are crazy, loud, smelly little things and wouldn’t change a thing. It took years to realize, but I now know raising boys was a good fit for me. I really like my alone time and moms of girls simply don't get as much.</p>
    <p>I was given the responsibility of raising boys for a reason. I had an absent father growing up and I had lost myself in a domestically violent relationship when I was younger. I do not take this responsibility lightly, the men I raise will be protectors and anyone who is in their space will be safe. I was chosen to raise these little humans to teach them how to be respectful, loving, individuals.</p>
    <p>There was a period of sadness, and it still creeps in every once in awhile when I think about having a daughter but my life is one that I wouldn’t change. Being a mama to boys has been, and will forever be the one of the things that brings me the most happiness.</p></section>
